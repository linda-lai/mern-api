# Mini-Project: Full-Stack MERN
Mini-project creating and practicing full-stack web application development with JavaScript MERN frameworks (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js).

## Challenge
This is an opportunity to get some practice with the technologies that we have covered so far. You will have all of today and tomorrow to do this, so take the time and opportunity to learn.

- Firstly, pick a topic that you like, and think about the data that you would need to make a web app based around that topic. If you are struggling for ideas you are welcome to do a Goodreads clone, or IMDB or whatever. But I think it would be good to start thinking about what your new skills can be used for in relation to the things that interest you.

- Get into pairs. Try to find a partner who has a different skill set from yourself. We would like you to work closely together with each other so that you get a better sense of the technologies that you are learning. Please try to pair sensibly, otherwise we will need to pair you up manually.

Because we arenâ€™t quite far enough into React, we need you to build the front end separate from the back end.

The back end will be *Node/Express*, *Mongo*, and *Mongoose*.

The front will be *React*. But because of where you are at with React, we want you to dummy up the data on the front end.You will need to discuss the structure of your data carefully so that when we do connect things up then things run smoothly.

Basically you will be making an in memory *JSON object* on the front end, and rendering some of this data to screen. Then build out the API that will serve this data.

Use the videos and the material from Jon as references. We will be around to help of course.
