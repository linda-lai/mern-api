# Mini-Project: Full-Stack MERN
Mini-project creating and practicing full-stack web application development with JavaScript MERN frameworks (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js).

## Challenge
This is an opportunity to get some practice with the technologies that we have covered so far. You will have all of today and tomorrow to do this, so take the time and opportunity to learn.

- Firstly, pick a topic that you like, and think about the data that you would need to make a web app based around that topic. If you are struggling for ideas you are welcome to do a Goodreads clone, or IMDB or whatever. But I think it would be good to start thinking about what your new skills can be used for in relation to the things that interest you.

- Get into pairs. Try to find a partner who has a different skill set from yourself. We would like you to work closely together with each other so that you get a better sense of the technologies that you are learning. Please try to pair sensibly, otherwise we will need to pair you up manually.

Because we aren’t quite far enough into React, we need you to build the front end separate from the back end.

The back end will be *Node/Express*, *Mongo*, and *Mongoose*.

The front will be *React*. But because of where you are at with React, we want you to dummy up the data on the front end.You will need to discuss the structure of your data carefully so that when we do connect things up then things run smoothly.

Basically you will be making an in memory *JSON object* on the front end, and rendering some of this data to screen. Then build out the API that will serve this data.

Use the videos and the material from Jon as references. We will be around to help of course.

# Boilerplate

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
